There is a single file that contains the instructions for this project.
The file is called "Data Course Project.R" and consists of 3 sections:

The first section are 10 steps to form a first Data Frame, the steps are as follows:
  Step 1 - I define a variable with the folder main path that contains the raw data
  Step 2 - Get and create a Data Frame with the "activity_labels.txt" file
  Step 3 - Get and create a Data Frame with the "features.txt" file
  Step 4 - Get and create a Data Frame with both Test and Train "subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt" files
  Step 5 - Get and create a Data Frame with both Test and Train "y_test.txt" and "y_train.txt" files
  Step 6 - Get and create a Data Frame with both Test and Train "X_test.txt" and "X_train.txt" files
  Step 7 - Create a Features Data Frame, only with the "mean" and "std" head texts in columns names
  Step 8 - Create a Data Frame with the columns required for both Test and Train called Test_DF and Train_DF respectively
  Step 9 - Create only one Data Frame from both Test_DF and Train_DF
  Step 10 - Merge the Data Frame with the file that contains the activities lables

The second section is the creation of Tidy Frame which has the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The third section is the creation of the file extension "TXT" to store the Data Frames.
